          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>Symbols and icons are everywhere we look, from hi-fis to washing machines. Once understood, their meaning is quickly communicated, but for the uninitiated theyâ€™re an intriguing puzzle.</p>

          <p>Born in Japan to make it quicker to communicate via text message, Emoji icons have become a global phenomenon since being adopted into the Unicode standard in 2010.</p>

          <p>Thanks to this, you can now use emoji in tweets, e-mails, and even URLs.</p>

          <p>The emoji graphics featured in this reference guide are from the AppleÂ ColorÂ Emoji typeface, primarily designed by Willem Van Lancker.</p>

          <p>This reference manual includes most of the 722 emoji symbols (some of the lesser interesting ones have been omitted), along with their unique hexadecimal reference.</p>

          <p>The emoji have been arranged in thematic groups, from people to objects.</p>

          <p>Looking through the emoji, they reveal some of the preoccupations with modern living, and give a glimpse into Japanese culture.</p>

          <p>Thereâ€™s no end to the imaginative ways that emoji can be used, from livening up your e-mails, to <a href="http://www.emojidick.com">a complete translation of Moby Dick</a>.</p>
